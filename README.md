<h2>Running If Bot Locally</h2>

32 bit JRE is required to run If Bot and starcraft 1.1.6
The SSCAIT tourament website will explain how to get starcraft 1.16 you can view it [here](https://sscaitournament.com/index.php?action=tutorial)

1. Download the Jar file from the SSCAIT website or directly [Here](https://sscaitournament.com/bot_binary.php?bot=If+Bot)
2. Paste ifBot.jar inside the bwapi-data folder inside starcraft game files
3. Modify bwapi.ini so the race is TERRAN and ai field is empty example: ai  = 
4. run a CMD command java -jar ifBot.jar file. 
5. Launch Chaos launcher with BWAPI injected(Tick BWAPI 4.1.2 injector (Release)), make sure the BWAPi.ini file is set up correctly (read #2)

<h2>What Issues did i face when developing the bot?</h2>
I started programming my AI with no programming experience at all. it was tough, but it was worth it.

<h2>Updates</h2>

<b>Build 14th June 2018:</b>

* Bot now attacks based on enemy Defences(Globally) and enemy unit scores
* Bot is less likely to attack near an enemy chokepoint within 2000 distance of the enemy base(To reduce mass suicide at chokepoints)
* Bot now builds more marines based difference between the enemy's and i's fap scores.
* Bot now builds more bunkers to defend against rush attacks
Unfortunally it counts globally, it will build bunkers even when the units arent attacking me
* Added a basic and untested anti lure script to stop units from being lured from bunkers when i'm the bot is defending
