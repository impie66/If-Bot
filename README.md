<h2>What Issues did i face when developing the bot?</h2>
<strong>Having to actually use my brain for once.</strong>

<hr />

<h2>Updates</h2>

<b>Build 14th June 2018:</b>

* Bot now attacks based on enemy Defences(Globally) and enemy unit scores
* Bot is less likely to attack near an enemy chokepoint within 2000 distance of the enemy base(To reduce mass suicide at chokepoints)
* Bot now builds more marines based difference between the enemy's and i's fap scores.
* Bot now builds more bunkers to defend against rush attacks
Unfortunally it counts globally, it will build bunkers even when the units arent attacking me
* Added a basic and untested anti lure script to stop units from being lured from bunkers when i'm the bot is defending
